# weather-app

The weather forecast project you have created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a web application that allows users to obtain up-to-date weather information for their location or any other city in the world. The application uses an API to fetch weather data from a remote server and display it on the web page.

The application includes a search bar that allows users to enter the name of a city and retrieve weather data for that location. When the user submits the search query, the application sends an API request to the server, which returns the current weather data for the specified city. The application then updates the web page to display the weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant information.

In addition to the search bar, the application also includes a geolocation feature that automatically retrieves the weather data for the user's current location. This feature uses the browser's geolocation API to determine the user's latitude and longitude and then sends a request to the weather API to fetch the current weather data for that location.

Overall, your weather forecast project is a useful and informative web application that provides users with real-time weather data for any location in the world. The use of APIs and geolocation technology adds a level of sophistication to the application and makes it more user-friendly and convenient to use.
